          An enthusiastic software engineer currently shaping the future of
          software development by designing smooth user-interfaces that promote

          I've always been passionate about colors, design learning about new
          technologies. Other than sitting in from of my display I enjoy myself
          in hiking and taking photo a long the way. I'm grateful that my job
          allows me to work from anywhere.
        </p>
        <p>
          I specialize in building web applications, leading front-end teams and
          developing visual design systems. I enjoy creating effortless user
          experience and designing delightful digital products. The entire
          process of going from a concept to release and gathering user's
          feedback on either client's or my own products is what makes me wake
          up everyday!
